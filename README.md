Bits and pieces I use to compose with Python and Csound.


ABOUT
-----

This project aims at organizing a large ammount of code writing  and/or
recycled while composing with Python and Csound. New files may be messy, poorly
programmed, lacking comments and disorganized. They should get cleaner over time.  

Modules contain Classes() and methods() that are more or less related. Read the
modules.md for a list of modules with their respective docstrings (todo).
